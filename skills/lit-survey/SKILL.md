# Literature Survey — Landscape Mapping & Gap Identification

Research topic: $ARGUMENTS

## Constants

- **PAPER_LIBRARY** — Local directory containing user's paper collection (PDFs). Check these paths in order:
  1. `papers/` in the current project directory
  2. `literature/` in the current project directory
  3. Custom path specified by user in `CLAUDE.md` under `## Paper Library`
- **MAX_LOCAL_PAPERS = 20** — Maximum number of local PDFs to scan (read first 3 pages each). If more are found, prioritize by filename relevance to the topic.
- **ARXIV_DOWNLOAD = false** — When `true`, download top 3-5 most relevant arXiv PDFs to PAPER_LIBRARY after search. When `false` (default), only fetch metadata (title, abstract, authors) via arXiv API — no files are downloaded.
- **ARXIV_MAX_DOWNLOAD = 5** — Maximum number of PDFs to download when `ARXIV_DOWNLOAD = true`.

> Overrides:
> - `/lit-survey "topic" -- paper library: ~/my_papers/` — custom local PDF path
> - `/lit-survey "topic" -- sources: zotero, local` — only search Zotero + local PDFs
> - `/lit-survey "topic" -- sources: zotero` — only search Zotero
> - `/lit-survey "topic" -- sources: web` — only search the web (skip all local)
> - `/lit-survey "topic" -- arxiv download: true` — download top relevant arXiv PDFs
> - `/lit-survey "topic" -- arxiv download: true, max download: 10` — download up to 10 PDFs

## Data Sources

This skill checks multiple sources **in priority order**. All are optional — if a source is not configured or not requested, skip it silently.

### Source Selection

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for a `-- sources:` directive:
- **If `-- sources:` is specified**: Only search the listed sources (comma-separated). Valid values: `zotero`, `obsidian`, `local`, `web`, `all`.
- **If not specified**: Default to `all` — search every available source in priority order.

Examples:
```
/lit-survey "diffusion models"                        → all (default)
/lit-survey "diffusion models" -- sources: all         → all
/lit-survey "diffusion models" -- sources: zotero      → Zotero only
/lit-survey "diffusion models" -- sources: zotero, web → Zotero + web
/lit-survey "diffusion models" -- sources: local       → local PDFs only
/lit-survey "topic" -- sources: obsidian, local, web   → skip Zotero
```

### Source Table

| Priority | Source | ID | How to detect | What it provides |
|----------|--------|----|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Zotero** (via MCP) | `zotero` | Try calling any `mcp__zotero__*` tool — if unavailable, skip | Collections, tags, annotations, PDF highlights, BibTeX, semantic search |
| 2 | **Obsidian** (via MCP) | `obsidian` | Try calling any `mcp__obsidian-vault__*` tool — if unavailable, skip | Research notes, paper summaries, tagged references, wikilinks |
| 3 | **Local PDFs** | `local` | `Glob: papers/**/*.pdf, literature/**/*.pdf` | Raw PDF content (first 3 pages) |
| 4 | **Web search** | `web` | Always available (WebSearch) | arXiv, Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar |

> **Graceful degradation**: If no MCP servers are configured, the skill works perfectly well with local PDFs + web search alone. Zotero and Obsidian are pure additions — their absence never causes a failure.

## Workflow

### Step 0a: Search Zotero Library (if available and requested)

**Skip this step entirely if Zotero MCP is not configured or `zotero` is excluded by `-- sources:`.**

Try calling a Zotero MCP tool (e.g., search). If it succeeds:

1. **Search by topic**: Use the Zotero search tool to find papers matching the research topic.
2. **Read collections**: Check if the user has a relevant collection/folder for this topic.
3. **Extract annotations**: For highly relevant papers, pull PDF highlights and notes — these represent what the user found important.
4. **Export BibTeX**: Get citation data for relevant papers.
5. **Compile results**: For each relevant Zotero entry, extract:
   - Title, authors, year, venue
   - User's annotations/highlights (if any)
   - Tags the user assigned
   - Which collection it belongs to

> Zotero annotations are gold — they show what the user personally highlighted as important, which is far more valuable than generic summaries.

> Zotero/Obsidian tools may have different names depending on how the user configured the MCP server (e.g., `mcp__zotero__search` or `mcp__zotero-mcp__search_items`). Try the most common patterns and adapt.

### Step 0b: Search Obsidian Vault (if available and requested)

**Skip this step entirely if Obsidian MCP is not configured or `obsidian` is excluded by `-- sources:`.**

Try calling an Obsidian MCP tool (e.g., search). If it succeeds:

1. **Search vault**: Search for notes related to the research topic.
2. **Check tags**: Look for notes tagged with relevant topics (e.g., `#diffusion-models`, `#paper-review`).
3. **Read research notes**: For relevant notes, extract the user's own summaries and insights.
4. **Follow links**: If notes link to other relevant notes (wikilinks), follow them for additional context.
5. **Compile results**: For each relevant note:
   - Note title and path
   - User's summary/insights
   - Links to other notes (research graph)
   - Any frontmatter metadata (paper URL, status, rating)

> Obsidian notes represent the user's **processed understanding** — more valuable than raw paper content for understanding their perspective.

### Step 0c: Scan Local Paper Library (if requested)

**Skip if `local` is excluded by `-- sources:`.**

Before searching online, check if the user already has relevant papers locally:

1. **Locate library**: Check PAPER_LIBRARY paths for PDF files.
   ```
   Glob: papers/**/*.pdf, literature/**/*.pdf
   ```

2. **De-duplicate against Zotero**: If Step 0a found papers, skip any local PDFs already covered by Zotero results (match by filename or title).

3. **Filter by relevance**: Match filenames and first-page content against the research topic. Skip clearly unrelated papers.

4. **Summarize relevant papers**: For each relevant local PDF (up to MAX_LOCAL_PAPERS):
   - Read first 3 pages (title, abstract, intro)
   - Extract: title, authors, year, core contribution, relevance to topic
   - Flag papers that are directly related vs tangentially related

5. **Build local knowledge base**: Compile summaries into a "papers you already have" section. This becomes the starting point — external search fills the gaps.

> If no local papers are found, skip to Step 1. If the user has a comprehensive local collection, the external search can be more targeted (focus on what's missing).

### Step 1: Web Search (if requested)

**Skip if `web` is excluded by `-- sources:`.**

- Use WebSearch to find recent papers on the topic.
- Check arXiv, Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar.
- Focus on papers from last 2 years unless studying foundational work.
- **De-duplicate**: Skip papers already found in Zotero, Obsidian, or local library.

**arXiv API search** (always runs within this step, no download by default):

Locate the fetch script and search arXiv directly:
```bash
# Try to find arxiv_fetch.py
SCRIPT=$(find tools/ -name "arxiv_fetch.py" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
# If not found, check common install locations
[ -z "$SCRIPT" ] && SCRIPT=$(find ~/.claude/skills/arxiv/ -name "arxiv_fetch.py" 2>/dev/null | head -1)

# Search arXiv API for structured results (title, abstract, authors, categories)
python3 "$SCRIPT" search "QUERY" --max 10
```

If `arxiv_fetch.py` is not found, fall back to WebSearch for arXiv (same results, less structured).

The arXiv API returns structured metadata (title, abstract, full author list, categories, dates) — richer than WebSearch snippets. Merge these results with WebSearch findings and de-duplicate.

**Search failure handling (autonomous mode)**:
- If a single WebSearch query fails: retry once with a different query formulation
- If the retry also fails: log the failure and move to the next query
- If arXiv API (`arxiv_fetch.py`) fails: fall back to WebSearch with "arxiv [topic]" queries
- If ALL web searches fail (e.g., network unavailable):
  1. Build the landscape map using Claude's training knowledge of the research area
  2. Clearly mark the output: "⚠️ OFFLINE MODE: This landscape was built from model training knowledge, not live search. Papers listed are real but may not include the most recent (2025-2026) publications."
  3. Continue pipeline normally — do NOT stop or ask the user
  4. The downstream skills can still use this landscape for idea generation and screening

**Semantic Scholar**: Also search via WebSearch with site:semanticscholar.org or the Semantic Scholar API if available. Semantic Scholar provides citation counts, influential citations, and TLDR summaries.

**Optional PDF download** (only when `ARXIV_DOWNLOAD = true`):

After all sources are searched and papers are ranked by relevance:
```bash
# Download top N most relevant arXiv papers
python3 "$SCRIPT" download ARXIV_ID --dir papers/
```
- Only download papers ranked in the top ARXIV_MAX_DOWNLOAD by relevance.
- Skip papers already in the local library.
- 1-second delay between downloads (rate limiting).
- Verify each PDF > 10 KB.

### Step 2: Analyze Each Paper

For each relevant paper found (from all sources combined), extract:

- **Paper ID**: Assign a short ID (e.g., `P01`, `P02`, ...) for cross-referencing in later steps.
- **Problem**: What gap does it address?
- **Method**: Core technical contribution (1-2 sentences).
- **Results**: Key numbers/claims.
- **Limitations**: Stated or inferred limitations of the approach.
- **Relevance**: How does it relate to the research topic?
- **Source**: Where we found it (Zotero/Obsidian/local/web) — helps the user know what they already have vs what is new.
- **Citation info**: Authors, year, venue, DOI/URL.

Aim for 15-30 papers total across all sources. If fewer than 10 papers are found, broaden the search terms. If more than 40, tighten the relevance filter.

### Step 3: Synthesize & Identify Gaps

#### 3a: Thematic Synthesis

- Group papers by approach/theme. Identify 3-7 major themes.
- For each theme, note:
  - Dominant approach or paradigm
  - Number of papers in the theme
  - Key consensus findings
  - Disagreements or open debates
  - Status: `active` (papers in last 2 years), `mature` (well-established, few new papers), `emerging` (1-2 papers, recent)
- If Obsidian notes exist, incorporate the user's own insights into the synthesis.
- Identify consensus vs disagreements in the field.

#### 3b: Gap Identification Matrix

After the thematic synthesis, systematically identify research gaps. For each gap, classify it by type and assign a confidence level.

**Gap Types** (enum — use exactly these labels):
- `cross-domain transfer` — A technique proven in domain A has not been applied to domain B, where it plausibly could work.
- `untested assumption` — A widely-held assumption in the field lacks direct empirical validation.
- `resolution opportunity` — Two contradictory findings in the literature can be resolved by a new experiment or formulation.
- `scaling frontier` — An approach works at small scale but has not been tested at larger/different scales.
- `missing diagnostic` — The field lacks a standard benchmark, metric, or diagnostic tool for a key question.
- `overlooked formulation` — An alternative mathematical or conceptual formulation has been ignored.

**Confidence Levels**:
- `HIGH` — Multiple papers corroborate the gap's existence; clear evidence of absence.
- `MEDIUM` — 1-2 papers hint at the gap; reasonable inference from the literature.
- `LOW` — Speculative; the gap is inferred from absence of evidence rather than evidence of absence.

Produce the following matrix (included in the final output):

```markdown
## Gap Identification Matrix

| Gap ID | Gap Description | Evidence (papers) | Gap Type | Confidence |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|----------|------------|
| G1     | [Concise description of the gap] | [P01], [P07] | cross-domain transfer | HIGH |
| G2     | [Concise description of the gap] | [P03], [P12], [P15] | untested assumption | MEDIUM |
| G3     | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

Aim for 5-15 gaps. Prioritize HIGH and MEDIUM confidence gaps. Include LOW confidence gaps only when they are particularly interesting or novel.

### Step 4: Output — Landscape Map

Create the `outputs/` directory if it does not exist:
```bash
mkdir -p outputs
```

#### 4a: `outputs/LANDSCAPE.md`

Write a comprehensive Markdown file with the following structure:

```markdown
# Literature Landscape: [Research Topic]

**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Papers analyzed**: [N]
**Sources**: [list of sources used]

## Executive Summary

[2-3 paragraph overview of the field's current state, key trends, and most significant gaps.]

## Paper Table

| ID | Paper | Authors | Year | Venue | Method | Key Result | Relevance | Source |
|----|-------|---------|------|-------|--------|------------|-----------|--------|
| P01 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | Zotero |
| P02 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | web |

## Thematic Analysis

### Theme 1: [Theme Name]
**Status**: active | mature | emerging
**Dominant approach**: [brief description]
**Papers**: P01, P05, P12

[2-3 paragraph discussion of this theme, key findings, and debates.]

### Theme 2: [Theme Name]
...

## Gap Identification Matrix

| Gap ID | Gap Description | Evidence (papers) | Gap Type | Confidence |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|----------|------------|
| G1     | ... | [P01], [P07] | cross-domain transfer | HIGH |
| G2     | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Trajectory Analysis

[If trajectory tracing was performed (see Step 4c below), include it here.
Otherwise, note: "Trajectory tracing was not performed. Run with `-- trace: true` to enable."]

## References

[Full citation list in a consistent format. If Zotero BibTeX was exported, include a `references.bib` snippet.]
```

#### 4b: `outputs/LANDSCAPE.json`

Write a machine-readable JSON file for consumption by downstream skills (`/idea-gen`, `/idea-screen`, `/idea-pipeline`):

```json
{
  "topic": "[research topic as provided by user]",
  "date": "[YYYY-MM-DD]",
  "paper_count": 25,
  "sources_used": ["zotero", "local", "web"],
  "papers": [
    {
      "id": "P01",
      "title": "...",
      "authors": ["Author A", "Author B"],
      "year": 2025,
      "venue": "NeurIPS",
      "method": "...",
      "key_result": "...",
      "relevance": "...",
      "source": "zotero",
      "url": "https://...",
      "themes": ["Theme A"]
    }
  ],
  "themes": [
    {
      "name": "Theme A",
      "papers": ["P01", "P05", "P12"],
      "status": "active",
      "dominant_approach": "...",
      "summary": "..."
    }
  ],
  "gaps": [
    {
      "id": "G1",
      "description": "...",
      "type": "cross-domain transfer",
      "evidence_papers": ["P01", "P07"],
      "confidence": "HIGH"
    }
  ],
  "trajectory": {
    "performed": false,
    "top_authors": [],
    "coauthor_clusters": []
  }
}
```

Validate the JSON is well-formed before writing. Use `python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('outputs/LANDSCAPE.json'))"` to verify.

#### 4c: Trajectory Tracing (optional, if time permits)

After the main search is complete and the core outputs are written, perform trajectory tracing to identify where the field is heading. This step is optional — skip it if the user signals time pressure or if the paper set is too small (fewer than 10 papers).

**Enable explicitly** with `-- trace: true` in the arguments, or perform automatically if the search yielded 15+ papers and no time constraint is indicated.

1. **Identify top authors**: From the analyzed papers, find the 3 most-cited or most-recurring authors.

2. **Trace publication arcs**: For each top author, use WebSearch to find their publications from the last 3 years. Identify:
   - What topics they are moving toward
   - What topics they are moving away from
   - Any new collaborations or lab changes

3. **Map co-author clusters**: From the paper set, build a rough co-authorship graph:
   - Identify 2-4 distinct research groups (clusters of authors who frequently co-publish)
   - Note if groups are converging on similar approaches or diverging
   - Flag any cross-group collaborations (potential convergence signals)

4. **Add to outputs**: Update `outputs/LANDSCAPE.md` with a "Trajectory Analysis" section and update the `trajectory` field in `outputs/LANDSCAPE.json`:

```json
"trajectory": {
  "performed": true,
  "top_authors": [
    {
      "name": "Author Name",
      "affiliation": "University/Lab",
      "recent_focus": "...",
      "direction": "moving from X toward Y",
      "key_recent_papers": ["title1", "title2"]
    }
  ],
  "coauthor_clusters": [
    {
      "label": "Group A (MIT)",
      "members": ["Author1", "Author2", "Author3"],
      "focus": "...",
      "relationship_to_other_groups": "competing with Group B on approach X"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Key Rules

- **所有输出使用中文。** LANDSCAPE.md 中的 Executive Summary、主题分析、Gap 描述均使用中文撰写。论文标题、作者名、会议名保留英文。LANDSCAPE.json 中的 description 字段也使用中文。
- Always include paper citations (authors, year, venue).
- Distinguish between peer-reviewed papers and preprints (mark preprints explicitly).
- Be honest about limitations of each paper.
- Note if a paper directly competes with or supports the user's likely approach.
- **Never fail because an MCP server is not configured** — always fall back gracefully to the next data source.
- If no papers are found from any source, report that clearly rather than inventing results.
- Paper IDs (P01, P02, ...) and Gap IDs (G1, G2, ...) must be consistent across the Markdown and JSON outputs.
- The JSON output must be valid JSON. Always verify before finishing.
- Write outputs to the `outputs/` directory relative to the current project root.

## Composing with Other Skills

This skill is the starting point for research ideation workflows:

```
/lit-survey "direction"    -> landscape map + gaps
/idea-gen "direction"      -> generates ideas using this landscape
/idea-screen               -> screens ideas against this landscape
/idea-pipeline             -> full workflow starting from this skill
```

The `outputs/LANDSCAPE.json` file is the primary handoff artifact. Downstream skills (`/idea-gen`, `/idea-screen`) read this file to ground their work in the actual state of the literature. When running `/idea-pipeline`, this skill executes first and its outputs feed automatically into the subsequent stages.
